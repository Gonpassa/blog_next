### Things to add

-   Create a `.env.local` file and add the following as `key = value`
    -   DB_STRING = `your database URI`
    -   PASS = `your password` (only for development)

## Lessons Learned:

This project sharpened my skills with Tailwind and React. As well as taught me many different things about Nextjs 13 and the App router. Using server side rendering for better SEO and pre-rendering by NextJs makes the application feel smoother.

Using the useContext hook to handle authentication context made it a breeze to implement different UI's for the blog owner and the blog readers.
